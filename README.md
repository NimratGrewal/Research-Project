# Research-Project
Research project repo
This repository stores the research project I have worked on this past semester for my economics data analysis course. We had to conduct formal 
economic research for our raw dataset and come up with a research question. We used python source code to extract meaningful information from the dataset 
and then create an academic paper from our findings. 

This paper tries to answer the research question: How have the temperatures across states in the US changed overtime and what patterns can be observed 
in different regions? Is there a correlation between temperature patterns and economic indicators in different regions? What factors may contribute 
to these changes?

I have used raw data from the Berkeley Earth website, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. There are 69, 613 observations 
total for the US states, which is where I have focused this paper.  

My paper adds a unique implementation of temperature analysis for several reasons. I have used a historic 50 year baseline average per state using
my data and compared that against the rest of the temperature figured until 2013 to see how to temperature has changed compared the the historic average. 


For my study I have used variables such as CO2 analysis, seasonal changes, annual averages with population density changes per state to see the 
relationship between temperature and these economic variables that may aid in further understanding of the research question.

Overall, this paper and coding helped me to think critically about how to approach data analysis and if my apprach makes sense in answering my 
research question. I will most likely continue working in this project since I think I can add a lot more meaningful economic datasets that I did not 
get the time to add through this semester.
